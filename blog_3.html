      <p>
        Hi everyone, I am <strong>Rahul Kuvlekar</strong>. I have recently
        started to explore different domains in Computer Science and technology
        field. I am the kind of person who wants to know and learn deeply about
        new technologies, gain more ideas, and even wanted to become educated
        about their workings. I love problem-solving, machine learning, neural
        networks, deep diving into their workings. Besides, I am also interested
        in web development and wanted to learn and explore more in-depth about
        web development technologies, as this could be a perfect opportunity for
        me to sharpen my skills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This is my first ever blog on any platform, and I am thankful to
        NeogCamp and our beloved Mentor Mr. Tanay Pratap, who inspired me to
        write it. I thought this could be a perfect opportunity for me to learn
        and document my journey. I have hesitated a lot lately, thinking that I
        do not know anything about blogging, I do not have anything to write
        and, this reminds me of a quote.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p style="background-color: #ffedd5; padding: 1rem">
          “ When you take risks, you learn that there will be times when you
          succeed and, there will be times when you fail, and both are equally
          important. ”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>More About Me.</strong>
        <br />
        I am pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science degree, and
        the only thing I learned in college was some basic CPP. I am not blaming
        my college and their curriculum, but I am blaming myself and my
        incompetence. But it is never too late to learn, to make things right
        and change your life, Right? Hence, I have started learning python,
        Machine Learning, and Neural Networks from YouTube videos and learned
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and the basics of ReactJS, NodeJS from
        NeogCamp level zero free YouTube course. Apart from this, I also love
        playing outdoor sports, reading self-development book, new gadgets and
        their technology, Exercising in the gym, and explore the thing in life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I hope I write many blogs on technologies, food, travel with learning
        new skills. So that all for the introduction and About Me!
